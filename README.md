![To do list]()
One of the first projects that I worked on. This was initially a static site that was populated from an Array but I further developed it to integrate with MySQL.

This App gives the user the ability to add a variety of items to a list as well as delete them. There is also a category section that users can add specific items to and have them grouped in an easy to find fashion. Users are also able to add and delete different categories as they wish.

This App also makes use of Express.JS Route Parameters which can capture the routes of specified values that a user may dynamically place into the address bar (list/:yourlistcategory). If the route does not exist it will add it to the Database but if it is found it will bring back all associated items to that particular parameter.
